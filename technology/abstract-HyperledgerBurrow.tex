Hyperledger Burrow is an open sourced smart-contract interpreter which was built 
in part to meet the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The 
Ethereum network has begun to see growth in the enterprise sector; with well known 
companies such as JP Morgan, Microsoft, Accenture and BP all recently joining the 
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Because of this widespread adoption, one of Burrowâ€™s 
claims to fame is that it is the only Apache-licensed Ethereum VM implementations 
on the market.\cite{Hyperledger Burrow}
