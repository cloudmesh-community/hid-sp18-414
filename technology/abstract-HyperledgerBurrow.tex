Hyperledger Burrow is an open sourced smart-contract interpreter which
was built to meet the requirements of the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. The Ethereum network has begun to see growth in the
enterprise sector; with well-known companies such as JP Morgan,
Microsoft, Accenture and BP all recently joining the Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance.\cite{Behlendorf} The importance around interpreting
smart contracts created by Ethereum cannot be understated, as Ethereum
has gained a lot of traction and credibility within the Cryptocurrency
community and currently at the time of writing has a market cap of 82
billion USD only second to Bitcoin. Because of this widespread
adoption of Ethereum, one of Burrowâ€™s claims to fame is that it is the
only Apache-licensed Ethereum VM implementations on the
market.\cite{Hyperledger Burrow}
